This is a World of Warcraft Addon, my first test project  .

It's license is public domain, I don't care if you fork/modify/take credit
for it as long as I am not held viable for it's usage.

This software comes with no warranty.

iRepair is meant to be a tool to check your durability and will provide
a few other nifty functions once it is completed.
